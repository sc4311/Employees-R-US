## Design Methodologies

### 1. Layered Architecture
The project follows a layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability. The main layers are:
- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses. It uses the `EmployeeController` class to define REST endpoints.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic. The `EmployeeService` interface and its implementation `EmployeeServiceImpl` handle operations related to employees.
- **Model Layer**: Defines the data structures. The `Employee` interface and its implementation `EmployeeImpl` represent the employee entity.

### 2. Dependency Injection
Spring's dependency injection is used to manage dependencies and promote loose coupling. The `EmployeeController` class uses constructor injection to get an instance of `EmployeeService`.

### 3. Thread-Safe Collections
The `EmployeeServiceImpl` class uses `CopyOnWriteArrayList` to store employees. This ensures thread safety when accessing and modifying the list of employees.

### 4. UUID for Unique Identification
Each employee is identified by a UUID, ensuring uniqueness across the system. The UUID is generated when a new employee is created.

### 5. Exception Handling
The `EmployeeController` class uses `ResponseStatusException` to handle errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes. This ensures that clients receive meaningful error messages.

### 6. Code Formatting
The project uses the Diffplug Spotless Gradle plugin to enforce code formatting and style guidelines. This ensures consistent code quality across the project.
