# ReliaQuest's Entry-Level Java Challenge

Please keep the following in mind while working on this challenge:
* Code implementations will not be graded for **correctness** but rather on practicality
* Articulate clear and concise design methodologies, if necessary
* Use clean coding etiquette
  * E.g. avoid liberal use of new-lines, odd variable and method names, random indentation, etc...
* Test cases are not required

## Problem Statement

Your employer has recently purchased a license to top-tier SaaS platform, Employees-R-US, to off-load all employee management responsibilities.
Unfortunately, your company's product has an existing employee management solution that is tightly coupled to other services and therefore 
cannot be replaced whole-cloth. Product and Development leads in your department have decided it would be best to interface
the existing employee management solution with the commercial offering from Employees-R-US for the time being until all employees can be migrated to the new SaaS platform.

Your ask is to expose employee information as a protected, secure REST API for consumption by Employees-R-US web hooks.
The initial REST API will consist of 3 endpoints, listed in the following section. If for any reason the implementation 
of an endpoint is problematic, the team lead will accept **pseudo-code** and a pertinent description (e.g. java-doc) of intent.

Good luck!

## Endpoints to implement (API module)

_See `com.challenge.api.controller.EmployeeController` for details._

getAllEmployees()

    output - list of employees
    description - this should return all employees, unfiltered

getEmployeeByUuid(...)

    path variable - employee UUID
    output - employee
    description - this should return a single employee based on the provided employee UUID

createEmployee(...)

    request body - attributes necessary to create an employee
    output - employee
    description - this should return a single employee, if created, otherwise error

## Code Formatting

This project utilizes Gradle plugin [Diffplug Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle) to enforce format
and style guidelines with every build.

To format code according to style guidelines, you can run **spotlessApply** task.
`./gradlew spotlessApply`

The spotless plugin will also execute check-and-validation tasks as part of the gradle **build** task.
`./gradlew build`
`./gradlew bootRun`
